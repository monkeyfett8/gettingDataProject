# This dataset shows cleaned and averaged data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset.

This dataset shows the reduced data for a set of data taken from smartphone accelerometers across 30 subjects ages 19-48 years of age and each performing 6 different tasks from walking to lying down.  

The script run_analysis.R takes data from the original source and transforms and simplify the data to the tables presented here.

# Run Script
### run_analysis.R

run_analysis.R downloads data from the original source (shown below). Once the data is obtained from the source it is cobined and orgaized through R.  For further information please see the Code Book (CodeBook.md)

# Data files included
